    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>1972 - Lisa Leslie was born on a hot summer day in Los Angeles. With two sisters and one brother, Leslie quickly learned how to help take care of everyone after her father left home when she was a baby. Leslie’s mother, Christine, stood over 6 feet 3 inches tall. So when Leslie hit 6 feet tall when she was in middle school, she was quickly recruited to join the basketball team. Reluctantly, she obliged, and the team went undefeated. In eighth grade, she transferred to a junior high school without a girls' basketball team, and joined a boys' basketball team. Her success there contributed to her confidence, and Leslie soon began to get serious about basketball.</p>

  <h2>The Legacy</h2>
  <p>The rise of a female powerhouse basketball player, coupled with the 90’s media takeoff, meant that Lisa Leslie largely influenced the creation and the success of the WNBA. Being one of the league’s first and best players sits high at the top of Leslie’s resume. For girls growing up in the NBA-only era, Leslie was a refreshing voice for young girls who loved the game. Seeing a female slam dunk was like realizing a dream was within reach. Leslie didn’t just set personal records, she invited all women to the table of professional basketball.</p>
