    <p>Triple threat; Lisa Leslie was an All-Star basketball player, Olympic gold medalist, and WNBA league MVP.</p>

  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
  <p>1972 - Lisa Leslie was born on a hot summer day in Los Angeles. With two sisters and one brother, Leslie quickly learned how to help take care of everyone after her father left home when she was a baby. Leslie’s mother, Christine, stood over 6 feet 3 inches tall. So when Leslie hit 6 feet tall when she was in middle school, she was quickly recruited to join the basketball team. Reluctantly, she obliged, and the team went undefeated. In eighth grade, she transferred to a junior high school without a girls' basketball team, and joined a boys' basketball team. Her success there contributed to her confidence, and Leslie soon began to get serious about basketball.</p>

  <h2>The Fame</h2>
  <p>At 14, before Leslie had even started high school, she had received more than 100 college recruiting letters. Continuing her takeover, she was her high school team's leading scorer and rebounder and led them to the California state championship during her Junior and Senior year. Between those two years, she was invited to participate on the USA's Junior World Championship team. Going into college, Leslie was the top recruit in the country. In her four years at USC, she set the conference record for scoring, rebounding, and blocked shots. Capping out her college career with the Naismith College Player of the Year award, Leslie goes down in history as one of the greatest to ever play at USC. In 2001, she was the first WNBA player to win the <a href="#Regular">*Regular Season MVP</a>, the <a href="#All">*All-Star Game MVP</a> and the <a href="#Playoff">*Playoff MVP</a> in the same season. Lisa also led the Los Angeles Sparks to two back-to-back WNBA Championships (2001, 2002). Lisa won 4 Olympic Gold medals and was the first woman in the WNBA to make a slam-dunk during an official game.
